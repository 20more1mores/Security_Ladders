# PRODUCT SECURITY: Generalist

**NOTE**: The generalist career ladder is meant for organizations that do not have the budget or ability to hire specialized individuals. While the skills listed below may seem overwhelming, trust us that these folks can be hired and are not purple :elephant: s

**ANALYSTS**: For the generalists track Product Security professionals, there are no ladder for Analyst. The rationale is that in order for an individual to perform these security duties, they must have a solid grounding as a software engineer or QA analyst and will not likely come into the ladder any lower than a Senior professional.
