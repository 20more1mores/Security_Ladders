# Security_Ladders

## Introduction

**Product Security Group** offers Security Ladders; a collection of documents to categorize the knowledge and experience expected of security experts at a given point during their careers.

## General structure

Specific area folders in `root` specifies a specific career track in the security field. Initially, Security Ladders covered 5 security areas:
* Chief Security Officer
* Information Risk
* Infrastucture Security
* Physical Security
* Product Security

These initially included three file types:
| File | Covers |
| ----- | ----- |
|[AREA]_Generalist.md|Expected duties/knowledge|
|[AREA]_NICE_MAPPING.md|Federal NICE equivalents|
|[AREA]_Boston_Laddder.md|salary/time-at-level expectations for Boston|

Product Security Group anticipates, with collaboration throughout the security field, to add more specific career ladders in each area and expand on salary/time expectations in other geographical locations.

The `root` folder also contains a folder for general knowledge, expected of all ladders and a folder for architects and technical managers that only applies to certain ladders.
