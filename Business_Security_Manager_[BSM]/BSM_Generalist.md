# BUSINESS SECURITY MANAGER: Generalist

**NOTE**: While it is not the exclusive path , this role is meant to be the feeder program to the Chief Security Officer title.

**ENTRY-LEVEL**: For the generalists track Business Security Manager professionals, there are no ladder for entry-level. The rationale is that in order for an individual to perform these security duties, they must have a solid grounding as security professional and will not likely come into the ladder any lower than a level 2 professional.

## Functional/Technical Knowledge

<!--- The BSM must have a specialty they focus on. That said, the must eventually achieve a basic level of competency in all security disciplines  --->
