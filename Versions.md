**Updates**

<ins>**Product Security Career Ladder**</ins> 

Special Thanks to Adam Shostack ( @adamshostack ) and Chris Romeo ( @edgeroute ) for their candid feedback on this ladder

**Changes**
1. SDL.4 - Moved the Appsec framework skills down from advisory to now start competency at the senior level.
2. TM.1 - Changed the threat modeling at the senior level to 'working' knowledge and moved the skill competency up from there.
3. SC.1 - Completely re-wrote the secure coding ladder to focus less on language knowledge and more on secure coding skills

**Additions**
1. DO.1 - After kicking around with folks, we decided to add a specific line item around DevOps to the appsec stream. It will likely get more content as we move forward but wanted to highlight that this is a skill Appsec people are going to need to start acquiring.
